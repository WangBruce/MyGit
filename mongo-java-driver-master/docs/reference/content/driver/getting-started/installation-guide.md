# Installation

There are two Maven artifacts available in the 3.0 release. The preferred artifact for new applications is `mongodb-driver` 
however, we still publish the legacy `mongo-java-driver` uber-jar.
The recommended way to get started using one of the drivers in your project is with a dependency management system.

## MongoDB Driver  

The MongoDB Driver is the updated synchronous Java driver that includes the
legacy API as well as a new generic MongoCollection interface that complies with
a new cross-driver CRUD specification.

## Uber MongoDB Java Driver
An uber jar that contains everything you need; the BSON library, the core library and the mongodb-driver.
